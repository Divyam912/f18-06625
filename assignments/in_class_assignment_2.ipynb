    "The reverse water gas shift reaction (rWGS) has been proposed as a way of turning waste CO$_2$ into carbon monoxide, which can be further hydrogenated to liquid fuels.  This reaction is as follows in the gas phase:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\ce{CO2 + H2 <=> CO + H2O}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The reverse water gas shift reaction is usually conducted on CuO/ZnO catalysts supported by alumina, but a group in literature suggested that a TiO$_2$ supported Pt catalyst might be more active.  You're going to help them estimate a reduced mechanism for this catalytic reaction."

This is a heterogeneous catalytic process, so the total number of surface sites is conserved."
